# Eager-Locomotive - Security Monitoring Stack ðŸš‚
(Kinesis+ElasticSearch+Kibana Stack for Security Monitoring)

## Overview

  As of March 2019, Amazon Web Services does not have a way of easily analyzing the logs it's services produce. The native AWS solutions are difficult to search, offer little retention capability, and lack robust alerting.

  The purpose of this project is to greatly simplify the process of deploying a basic security monitoring stack on AWS by defining the entire stack as a repeatable `Terraform` plan.

Features

* ElasticSearch - Scalable cluster for log consolidation
* Cloudtrail - Management and data events delivered to ElasticSearch
* Lambda - Delivers JSON blobs to Kinesis streams
* Kinesis Stream - Scalable event queue for incoming log data
* Kinesis Firehose - Real-time delivery of events from streams, to ElasticSearch
* Extensible - Adding a log sources is simple and efficient
